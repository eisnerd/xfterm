Terminal Documentation
======================

A bit of information about how to handle the documentation in Terminal
for both maintainers and translators.


Building Documentation
----------------------

If you download a release of Terminal, you don't need to build the
documentation, because the (translated) HTML pages are already
included in the tarball.
However, if you make a clone from GIT or you add your own translation
and you want to see the result; you have to generate the documentation
during the build. This can be done by following the steps below:

  * Make sure you have the xfce-dev-tools, gnome-doc-utils (for xml2po)
    and libxslt (for xsltproc) packages installed.
  * Create a GIT clone; "git clone git://git.xfce.org/apps/terminal".
  * Run "./autogen.sh --enable-gen-doc" and make sure the build
    configuration shows "Generate documentation: yes".
  * Run "make" and "make DESTDIR=/some/prefix install".


Updating the po(t) files
------------------------

Normally this is only needed when the Terminal.xml file is edited, but
in case you wonder:

  * ./autogen.sh --enable-gen-doc
  * cd doc && make update-po.


Adding New Translations
-----------------------

New translations can easily be added by translating the doc/po/Terminal.pot
file in Transifex [https://translations.xfce.org]. Before you submit your
translated po file, make sure it passes the build process without errors
and warnings. See more information about this in the "Building
Documentation" section above (you can run "make clean && make" in the doc/
directory to rebuild the documentation).
After running "make", check for the errors and warnings of your translation
and try to fix them. Please do this before submitting in Transifex to
avoid build problems for other people.


Add Images In Your Locale
-------------------------

You might have noticed your new translated documentation still uses the
English screenshots. These can the "translated" too by following the
steps below:

  * Make sure you use the same theme as the default images.
    - Clearlooks default Gtk theme (from gtk-engines package).
    - Tango icons.
    - Default-4.6 Xfwm4 theme.
    - Bitstream Vera Sans Roman font.
  * Create the screenshots, for example by using The GIMP and give them
    the same filenames are the English ones.
  * Put those in a tarball and create a bug in the Xfce bug tracker
    [http://bugzilla.xfce.org] under the Terminal product and
    Documentation component with the tarball attached.
  * One of the developers will manually add the images to the GIT
    repository, so be patient.
