Bug tracking system
===================

Terminal uses the bug tracking system at http://bugzilla.xfce.org/
hosted and maintained by the Xfce Project.


Patches
=======

Please submit patches to the Xfce bug tracking system. Your patch
should be in unified diff format (the -u option to GNU diff).

Please and send a patch against a recent version of this package. Patches
against the GIT master branch are most preferable. You can always
access the master branch from

  http://git.xfce.org/apps/terminal/

or clone the repository with GIT

  git clone git://git.xfce.org/apps/terminal


Feature requests
================

Please file feature requests to the Xfce bug tracking system
(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, classification Apps, product Terminal)
with a Severity of enhancement. Make sure that your feature request
wasn't reported already before; requesting a feature several times
won't increase the chance that it gets added.


Coding Style
============

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions, mostly the same
   as GTK+.
 - Always expand tabs. This differs from the GNU suggestion, but is
   necessary!
 - Don't follow the philosophy "If it works, it's right" that most
   open source projects follow, instead Terminal's philosophy is
   "It doesn't work unless it's right".
