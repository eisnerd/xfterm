0.2.4
=====
- You can now open hyperlinks (and email addresses) from within Terminal by
  either middle-clicking the hyperlink or choosing the appropriate item from
  the right-click menu. This feature is optional and can be disabled.
- When terminal background was set to "background image" and the user opened
  a new terminal tab, the background image was not always set properly. This
  is fixed now.
- A new hidden option "MiscCycleTabs" was added to allow users to circulate
  through terminal tabs, similar to what Mozilla Firefox does by default.
- Another new hidden option "MiscTabCloseButtons" was added to allow users to
  disable the close buttons in the terminal tab headers.
- The keyboard shortcuts to go to a specific terminal tab now work properly
  even if the main menu bar is hidden.
- Added the possibility to let Vte auto-detect the backspace and delete bindings
  for the terminal.
- Changed default paste shortcut to Shift+Ctrl+V.
- The configuration file is watched for changes now and will be reread
  automatically. You no longer need to restart Terminal if you manually edited
  the terminalrc file.
- Terminal now supports D-BUS 0.23 (and earlier) and D-BUS 0.31 (and later),
  while the dependency on D-BUS is optional.
- The output of "Terminal --help" now properly shows the translation (if any)
  instead of the english text.
- Various usability improvements.
- Updated translations: os-cillation (de), Stephane Roy (fr), Jasper Huijsmans
  (nl).
- New translations: Jari Rahkonen (fi), Yuval Tanny (he), Daichi Kawahata (ja),
  Anthony Ivanoff (ru), Army Gu (zh_CN)

0.2.2
=====
- A command line option --fullscreen was added to put a new window into
  fullscreen mode automatically.
- Users can open only one preferences dialog per terminal window now.
- The shortcut for the commandline option --title is now -T, because that
  seems to be common among terminal emulators. -t is still supported for
  compatbility with gnome-terminal, but may be removed in the future.
- Remote displays are supported properly now. But multi-screen mode will only
  work with solid background until the Vte guys fix the multi-screen issue
  (see http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=160782).
- Modifiers like <Mod2> or <Lock> are now stripped off when using the
  shortcut editor, since it turned out that they don't work properly with
  some X setups.
- Pressing Shift<F10> also pops up the right-click menu now.
- Fixed a bug where the size was not always properly set when opening a
  new terminal tab.
- A new toplevel menu "Go" was added, which includes "Prev Tab", "Next Tab"
  and a list of currently active tabs. People who use a customized Terminal.ui
  will need to sync their copy with the default Terminal.ui file in order
  to see this change.
- New shortcuts have been added to allow fast switching to the first 9
  terminal tabs; the shortcuts default to Alt+#.
- The terminal tab close button is now properly rendered with Gtk+ themes
  that are based on the "pixmap" engine.
- The "Use colors from system theme" option was removed, as it was mostly
  unusued and its really not a required option after all (I don't know any
  Gtk+ theme that specifies colors for VteTerminal anyways).
- You can now scroll up/down by one line using Shift+Up and Shift+Down, in
  the same manner as in aterm.
- A new option "Allow bold text" was added, to control whether or not
  Terminal will attempt to draw bold text by repainting text with a
  different offset.
- Added the possibility to detach tabs from a given Terminal window and
  reopen that tab in a new window. This functionality is available from
  a right-click menu that was added to the tab title widgets.
- The about dialog now uses the Terminal application icon instead of the
  terminal-general stock icon.
- The terminal service now checks the user id of callers and if the
  user ids doesn't match the caller will automatically run in its
  own Terminal instance. This allows users to run Terminal with different
  users without having to supply the --disable-server option, e.g. running
  "sudo Terminal" (please note that this is not recommended!).
- Several other bugs and glitches have been fixed.
- New translations: Dwayne Bailey (en_GB), Hydonsingore Sie (zh_TW),
  Jaime Buffery (es)
- Updated translations: os-cillation (de), Jasper Huijsmans (nl_NL)
- The documentation has been updated.


0.2.0

- The user interface was reworked to comply with the GNOME Human Interface
  Guidelines (HIG).

- The preferences dialog and the title dialog are now accessible.
- Avoid flickering when opening a new terminal.
- The terminal background is now set up before the terminal is mapped on
  screen.
- Menu access keys can now be disabled, which allows passing key combinations
  such as Alt+f to the application running inside the terminal.
- Font-antialiasing can now be turned off for the terminal font rendering,
  which impressively speeds up Terminal performance and reduces system
  load on slow systems.
- Optional support for startup notification was added.
- A bunch of new command line options were added, which allow the user
  to control every aspect of a terminal window from the command line and
  its also possible to open multiple windows and multiple tabs from the
  command line.
- The terminal title can now be changed by double-clicking the terminal
  tab header.
- Multi-screen and multi-display configurations are now properly supported
  by Terminal.
- A bug in the backspace binding preference was fixed, which caused Terminal
  to use Control+H if the user configured ASCII DEL and vice versa.
- Support for session management was added (using X11R5 WM_SAVE_YOURSELF).
- Added a confirmation dialog, that pops up when a window with more than
  one tab is about to be closed. The confirmation can be disabled from
  the dialog.
- Icons are now built into the Terminal binary to avoid the 100-500ms
  increase in startup time when using the icon lookup functions in
  libxfcegui4.
- If an application running inside the terminal supports using the
  mouse (like mc for example), Terminal automatically disables the
  right-click menu and forwards all button clicks to the application
  instead. Hold down shift while pressing the right mouse button to
  get a right-click menu in this situation.
- Several bugfixes and improvements have been integrated into Terminal
  (in order to reduce code-size and startup time).
- The D-BUS interface was changed to include a version number and to
  pass the argument vector instead of the parsed options to the
  Terminal service.
- The online documentation and the manual page have been updated.

- Terminal now defaults to current working directory if no --working-directory
  command line switch was specified.
- The documentation was updated and a manual page for Terminal was added.


0.1.9
=====
- The configure option --enable-final now enables linker optimizations for
  plattforms that support it (recent GNU binutils required).

  customize their menus rudimentarily.
- The documentation was updated.


0.1.8
=====
- Background darkness setting is now restored correctly.

  randomly opening a new tab

  pendently.

- The output of Terminal --help was improved to list all options with
  descriptions of their functionality.
- The Preferences dialog was changed to use GtkFrame instead of XfceFramebox
  to get a smoother look.
